Maybe worth mentioning that if translations exceed the max length, they are considered "not done" until localizers fix them (unless this has changed), and that length errors are not displayed in the webdashboard.

I've just noticed that there's a new branch with more changes to these files. Since it's a different branch, it won't show up here…

I really suggest to not use the online editor, clone the repository offline and work on a branch. This doc has enough info to get started URL.

.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-206828089\pr-comment-100570450.json . 
For existing locales I think it makes sense to use dev-l10n. Also, based on the text of the link, I assumed the link the dev-l10n-new-locales was a copy and paste error from the previous paragraph.

When you are on the main page of the pull request, you should see a link "Add your review" since your review was explicitly requested. Click it and select "Approve changes".

In the future, you can use the same process to request updates. When you comment, select "Start a review". Then you can use the button on the top corner to complete your review, and choose if it's just comments, approved or require changes.

I think everything looks good. We can always fix minor stuff later (I'll do a direct pass on the single quotes).
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\comment-280827855.json . 
For reference: URL.

Straight quote -> apostrophe, no double spaces, use * instead of - for lists. There was already a lot going on here and didn't want to bother you with nits :-)

.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-100983603.json . 
Nit: it's not 6 weeks anymore, it's variable (6-8 weeks).
Also: merge day is when localizations move to the next train, and the last day available to include localization updates to the next Beta version if you work on tools like Pootle.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-100983830.json . 
General nit, feel free to ignore it: the rest of the documentation uses ’ (apostrophe) instead of a straight quote. Nothing bad if you keep it like this, just better consistency if you update it.

I have the feeling you misread my comment (or it wasn't clear): I was asking you to add a link to these 2 documents in the README, not to link the README from these docs.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101456938.json . 
Let's point them to URL and specify that they can bookmark their locale's team page.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101456988.json . 
nit: "should be doing" instead of "start doing", to avoid start…start.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101457035.json . 
If we point them to the team's page, you need to update this paragraph and the following.

I would ask them to focus on errors and warnings alone.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101457264.json . 
I'd move this sentence right after the 8 weeks one.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101457720.json . 
Actually, re-reading it, it wasn't really clear :thumbs_down_sign:(it was in my head). Feel free to drop this paragraph.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101828518.json . 
Do you mean I should change the link to the dashboard to the teams page? Or add the teams page (and the fact they can bookmark their own) as additional information?
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101828704.json . 
I think we should not send them to shipping, so replace the existing link with the teams one.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101828909.json . 
If it makes things easier, you could point to a specific locale's team page, explaining that you can replace the locale code in the URL or search for your team in the /teams page. I think the latter would be enough.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101828927.json . 
OK waiting to hear back on comment above for this.
Concerning focusing on errors and warning alone: I have a feeling I'm already doing that. Do you think I'm giving too much information and should strip that down? Or were you thinking of something else?
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101829911.json . 
Actually, warnings are not even displayed on that page (didn't remember that :-\)
URL.

I meant that they should not be focusing on orange or green icon, only on the number of errors and warnings (in /shipping). On the team's page, only on error notices and finding them in the linked page.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101830602.json . 
Aha, that makes sense :thumbs_up_sign: 
Agreed, will update accordingly.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101844434.json . 
teams -> locale's, also column twice later.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101845621.json . 
Thanks!
Concerning the readme: I didn't change it because looking at it now, I don't really see where that would fit.
It already links to the Android and Firefox folders in the 1st bullet point, and then you list out what they contain. I would need to probably reformat all this it want to add direct links to these docs.
Should I just do that? .
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938\pr-comment-101879681.json .

the production -> production, or the production server
webpage dashboard -> web dashboard

I don't think we should explain tags to them, they don't see them. We should just tell them that new strings added to existing pages are visible in production only when localized, unless they're in a shared file.

For the last part, the concept is that sometimes a completely new template is used for a page, e.g. the home page, and that deadlines are strict: after the deadline, the old template will be disabled. All these big changes are communicated well in advance on the mailing list.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102319514.json . 
change it to be more specific: "... or they will be redirected to en-US if the pages are not." If this is still wrong or confusing, we need to change the sentence. The point is that they should check the links. .
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102319854.json . 
add "If they are not, they should be redirected to en-US pages."

change to "Is your language listed as one of the options? Check www.mozilla.org/en-US to confirm."
I didn't know it is not. should we hook it up with CLDR library?  .
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102320504.json . 
Links might external to mozilla.org, on websites that are en-US only. It's a bit hard given how many possibilities there are.

Even if they are on mozilla.org, it might be pages that we don't localize. 

Personally I would drop both sentences, maybe only add a note about testing the links to verify that the translation of the link is coherent and the link is functional.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102320954.json . 
Remember the bug for contact in the FFOS development days? Same issue. Is the language sorting order by ISO code or in language specific order? This is mostly a problem for non-Latin character based languages, such as CCJK, etc.  I can remove it if the list goes by English alphabet order.  .
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102321218.json . 
What's unclear to me is which dropdown list they should check… Also, it's not necessarily true that a dropdown should be ordered.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102321425.json . 
On second thoughts, safer to tell them to check URL.

If the home page is not fully localized, their locale won't be listed on prod.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102321449.json . 
From what I understand, the "mirror" effect is not exactly 100% flip over horizontally.  I am not clear if we follow industry standard or Mozilla standard, this is why i made it vague, as the standard is not unified (I can't recall all the details", but as long as the localizers, especially new comers know what it is, it is fine.
.

Can you drop (locale) from this link? If you look at the page you'll understand why
URL.

Keep a working URL here, add a note later that pages on mozilla.org should redirect to the right locale, if they don't you can add your locale code. Same for the webdashboard link later.

No double spaces after period, one empty line after is enough.

We need to simplify this, e.g.



In some cases pages receive major updates that require a complete rewrite of the template: if this happens, the old template is kept online only for a short period of time and, when removed, it will cause the URL to redirect users to the English version.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102545047.json .

.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102549340.json . 
Yes, but it is open to all locales (both donate.mozilla.org and the strings on mozilla.org takeover). We can add more currencies as we add locales, but it is true that we are limited by the  currencies supported by Stripe and Paypal. We can support any of those for Stripe: URL.
And any of those for Paypal: URL.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102550853.json . 
We should also mention that those strings are not always available for testing, and that the takeover only appears once in a given tab.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-209257131\pr-comment-102555632.json .

The country list is definitely on the form when people fill out personal info. but if this is provided by third party, then we don't have any control. Having said that, the donation process expects donors to understand English ^-^. People will not provide personal info if the process is not in their language, especially with money involved.

@TheoChevalier, @flodolo, we can remove the sync and signup sections if the rest of the newly added content is ok.  so we can release it for the agencies that need it.  We can figure out what to add for sync and if we need to keep signup page.  .

Recap of IRC discussion with Delphine. 

If you use Atom, you can install a package called smart-quotes-plus (go into Preferences, select Install on the left, search for the name and install it).

Then use ctrl+alt+' to swap all quotes to the correct ones (you can do it also on a selection of text). Make sure that you don't do that on a document that contain ' (e.g. code fragments). If you don't remember the shortcut, you can press alt+shift+p and search for smartquotes.

Not sure if we want something in the docs about this.

#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-215815368\pr-comment-107236343.json . 
Are these shipping locales, or enabled locales? Or am I completely lost and those are the locales supported by the store? We are referring to shipping locales later in the doc. I know some time ago we had two separate lists, one for the shipping locales, one for the enabled locales, I assume this is still the case. Not sure if it’s worth mentioning that the list need to be maintained, or if it’s something obvious enough (or already mentioned many times in this doc)
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-215815368\pr-comment-107237874.json . 
Good point. It's shipping locale, as in locales that are available in the app. Will udpate.

@gueroJeff, @Delphine, @TheoChevalier, at the moment, i am stuck with this doc not making any progress.  If it is ok as it stands, knowing we can update at a later time with new and different info, can we go with this doc.  Only @flodolo provided feedback. He has specifically highlighted the areas that lack reasons for certain tasks. Do you feel the same?  

Given the new dimension of working with agency, such as marketing agency, I will need to add a new section for that, if this interests anyone other than me, :).  This new process may be duplicated in Asia in the coming months.  .

Theo, let's merge it and add changes later.

I reread the CASA process, it is not far from what we stated here, I just need to blend some of the content in the MSA (legal review) and PO part (finance review) text we have with links. I also need to verify if we are doing away the form about banking info, a form that should live in the system, not as an attachment sent in an email.  .

block-code.

This is not correct: if you rename a file completely localized for locale X in the repository, Pontoon will read it, expose it as completely translated as it was before. What you're losing is history, attribution, pending suggestions.

@adngdb , apologize for taking this long to review the doc. Finally I have a real project so I can give it an official run. The instruction is clear and I can follow through the steps and the output is what I expected.

I do have some questions for you to see if you have tips or advice on how to process the project in as little time as possible. After I tried the process on staging, all looked good. When I switch to production side, I have to front load the strings, select the languages, and save the project. Only after this step, when the project technically has gone public, that I can "manage strings" - add comments, check that the strings are all in the right place and in the correct sequence. 

What I am afraid is that as soon as the strings go public, localizers start to translate right away. Are there workarounds to either shorten my prep time or disable the project until I am ready to publish it (Save Project):.

A: Can I Save Project and Disable it at the same time so I can "Manage strings"? Once done, uncheck Disabled box? 
B: Alternatively, if there is a way to upload the file I prepared at staging to production (since I have checked it there already) to reduce the time needed prepping on production? 

Thank you!

#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-276022267\comment-360833025.json . 
For this email project, since we are covering all the email languages, I will set it up the standard way. 

Is there a way to preserve the comment in the output file? URL This has a lot of comments. Alternatively, I can copy the translated strings to the original file from the requester.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-276022267\comment-360846556.json . 
@peiying2 You can indeed disable the project, save it, make all your changes and the de-disable it to make it available to localizers. I'm afraid at the moment there's no better solution for you. We talked about having a better form of import at a second step to this, but we wanted to make sure that the feature was useful first. Now that you're using it, how about we take some time to work on the various improvements you'd like to see? Maybe setup a meeting next week? 

For the moment, I see two features: add comments to the export document, and allow importing that same document (so that you can setup on stage, then just have to export / import to prod). .
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-276022267\comment-360852151.json . 
@adngdb I can totally use the Disabled feature for the time being. I know you are super booked with other requests. If you have time to work on this, assuming the solution is not too complicated, then let's resolve this. Next Wednesday and Thursday mornings (my time) look good. Please find a slot to have a quick chat. Thank you!

#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-276022267\comment-360949596.json . 
@adngdb this is the first: URL Given most of the requests come from marketing, can we have a high level project name, and sub-category (check Engagement project for reference). Otherwise, all the requests have a very flat structure, and may flood a locale dashboard very quickly. All the individual file name will be called "database". This is only a "wish". If this means spending a lot of your time to improve the feature, then don't do it. Thanks!

#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-276022267\comment-364283134.json . 
@adngdb, I have added more strings to the existing project. Initially I added to the production side directly but on the status bar, it shows 100% completion, so I clicked on the link, at file level, it does show the strings waiting to be completed, but between the % icon and the status bar, a localizer won't know something new is added to an existing project at higher level. I went to the staging site to add these strings, it didn't fix the problem. The Sync button is for repo type of project, not database type, but I tried it too, :). It didn't work. We need to have the status feature fixed. .

I'm not sure if this is the right place: if you run the script at this point, you will end up with changed files before creating a branch, new files will be potentially added to the appstores repository, etc.

I would put it into a separate section with its own title, e.g. "Updating the list of supported locales".

Another thing to call out: If the script changes the list of locales, it's important to run inline-code to add missing files in appstores.

Hmm on second thoughts, I'm thinking I'm not explaining things correctly in the multi-locale doc.
Is it that you only remove it from the "exclude-multi-locale" section once you've added the locale to multi-locales and done a sign-off so that it is now on Beta? I'm not quite sure how this is supposed to work, not having done it before :/ thanks for helping clarify that part!
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-292635964\comment-361554682.json . 


Right now it doesn't have a practical effect, but it's correct as it is right now: you add the file to maemo-locales and remove it from the excluded list at the same time, since these two operations have the same goal (add locale to multi-locales build).

For both, you need a sign-off on Beta before it goes to build.
